The executor mode to use. The following options are available:

  Runs every TestCycle consecutively in the main thread. This mode does not create any extra processes or threads for grading.

- "thread" ::
  Creates a separate thread for every TestCycle. This mode greatly speeds up the grading process, especially with a large
  amount of submissions. The overhead of creating, managing and synchronizing threads is minimal compared to the performance
  benefits. However, this mode has the danger of creating "unkillable" threads (e.g. from certain kinds of infinite loops)
  which dramatically slow down the grading process through resource starvation of the host machine.

  The maximum number of concurrent threads used for grading is defined by the option "concurrency".

- "process" ::
  Creates a separate process for every TestCycle. This mode has the most overhead, but is also the most defensive against
  "badly behaving" code. A certain amount of sandboxing can be achieved in this mode, which is not possible in the other modes
  such as "thread" or "single".
